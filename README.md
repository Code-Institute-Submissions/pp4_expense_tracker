## About
Money Bee is an expense tracker application. Through the app, users can track income and expenses. A user, in reality, has multiple bank accounts, credit cards and debit cards. To facilitate that, the concept of "wallet" is introduced. It represents a single bank account or a credit/debit card. As a part of MVP, a bar chart tells you total income and expenses across multiple wallets. At the moment, the user can create as many wallets as necessary. However, the user is limited to expense and income categories provided by the admin, which is to be improved in the next sprint.
